    "### A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed on a computer system. Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently and securely. Databases can be of various types, but the most common types are SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with columns and rows. SQL databases use a schema to define the structure of the data, and the data in each table is organized based on relationships between tables. SQL databases are good for complex queries and data that can be organized into a structured format. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, do not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, NoSQL databases use a document-based or key-value-based data model, which makes them more flexible and scalable than SQL databases. NoSQL databases are ideal for storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, images, or JSON data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in the way they store and organize data. SQL databases use a structured approach that is ideal for complex queries and data that can be organized into a relational structure, while NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable and are better suited for unstructured or semi-structured data."

    "\n",
    "### (1) CREATE: This command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure. For example, suppose we want to create a new table called \"customers\" with three columns: \"id\", \"name\", and \"email\". The SQL code for creating this table would be:\n",

    "--> CREATE TABLE customers (\n",

    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",

    "### (2) DROP: This command is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, suppose we want to delete the \"customers\" table that we created earlier. The SQL code for dropping this table would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "--> DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, suppose we want to add a new column called \"phone\" to the \"customers\" table that we created earlier. The SQL code for altering this table would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "--> ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "### (4) TRUNCATE: This command is used to remove all the rows from an existing table. For example, suppose we want to remove all the data from the \"customers\" table that we created earlier, but we don't want to delete the table itself. The SQL code for truncating this table would be:\n",
    " \n",
    "--> TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, CREATE is used to create a new database object, DROP is used to delete an existing database object, ALTER is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, and TRUNCATE is used to remove all the rows from an existing table."

    "### (1) INSERT: This command is used to add new rows of data to a table. For example, suppose we have a table called \"employees\" with columns \"id\", \"name\", \"salary\", and \"department\". To insert a new row of data into the \"employees\" table, we would use the following SQL code:\n",
    "\n",
    "--> INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary, department)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 50000, 'Sales');\n",

    "\n",
    "### (2) UPDATE: This command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, suppose we want to update the salary of the employee with an ID of 1 in the \"employees\" table. The SQL code for updating this data would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "--> UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "### This code updates the salary of the employee with an ID of 1 in the \"employees\" table to 55000.\n",

    "\n",
    "--> DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;\n",

    "\n",
    "### SELECT: This command is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It is also used to perform calculations on data and return the result of those calculations. For example, suppose we have a table called \"orders\" with columns \"id\", \"customer_id\", \"product_name\", and \"price\". To retrieve all rows of data from the \"orders\" table, we would use the following SQL code:\n",
    "\n",
    "--> SELECT * FROM orders;\n",
    "\n",
    "### This code retrieves all rows of data from the \"orders\" table and returns all columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We can also select specific columns by listing them after the SELECT keyword. For example, suppose we only want to retrieve the \"id\" and \"product_name\" columns from the \"orders\" table. The SQL code for this query would be:\n",

    "--> SELECT id, product_name FROM orders;\n",

The primary key constraint ensures that the values in the primary key column(s) are unique and not null.

The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table, or are null.
