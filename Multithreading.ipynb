    "### Multithreading in Python refers to the ability to execute multiple threads (smaller sub-tasks) concurrently within a single process. Each thread runs independently, and multiple threads can run simultaneously within the same program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of applications that require parallelism. By splitting a large task into multiple threads, each thread can work on a smaller part of the task simultaneously, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the task. Multithreading is particularly useful in I/O-bound applications where the threads can overlap I/O operations with other computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The module used to handle threads in Python is the 'threading' module. It provides a simple and efficient way to create, start, and manage threads in Python. The 'threading' module allows you to create a new thread by instantiating the 'Thread' class and passing a callable object (usually a function) as an argument. You can also use the 'Lock' class from the threading module to synchronize access to shared resources between multiple threads."

For example, you can use it to get the name of the current thread, or to set attributes on the thread.\n",

It returns a list of Thread objects, which can be used to identify and manipulate the threads that are currently running in your application. This can be useful for monitoring the status of threads in your application, or for debugging purposes. By default, the main thread is also included in the list of threads returned by this function."

    "### 1. run(): This method is called when a new thread is started and is used to define the code that the thread will execute. It is meant to be overridden by a subclass of Thread, which can define its own run() method to provide custom behavior for the thread. The run() method should contain the code that the thread will execute when it starts running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. start(): This method is used to start a new thread of execution. It creates a new thread object and calls the run() method of the thread object in a separate thread of execution. Once the new thread is started, control returns immediately to the calling thread, which can continue with its own execution. The start() method should be called once on each thread object to start the thread.\n",

    "### 3. join(): This method is used to wait for a thread to finish its execution. It blocks the calling thread until the thread being joined completes its execution. If the thread being joined has already finished, the join() method returns immediately. The join() method can also be called with a timeout parameter, which specifies the maximum time to wait for the thread to finish.\n",

Deadlocks can cause a program to become unresponsive, as the threads involved are unable to make progress.\n",

For example, if two threads simultaneously attempt to modify a shared variable, the final value of the variable may depend on the order in which the threads execute, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results."
