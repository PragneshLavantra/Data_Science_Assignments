    "### Yes, tuples are immutable in Python. This means that once a tuple is created, you cannot change the values it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the main characteristics of tuples in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Immutable: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. This makes tuples suitable for representing data that should not change over time, such as dates, colors, or geographic coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of the elements they contain, so you can access elements by their position in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Indexed: Tuples can be accessed using an index, just like lists. The first element in a tuple has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Iterable: Tuples can be iterated over using a for loop, just like lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Named: Tuples can be named, just like variables, to make them easier to reference and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Lightweight: Tuples are more lightweight than lists, as they do not require the same level of memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, tuples are immutable, ordered, indexed, iterable, heterogeneous, named, and lightweight."

    "### Tuples in Python have two built-in methods: count and index.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) count method: The count method is used to count the number of occurrences of a specific value in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    "t.count(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "-> output: 2\n",

    "### Tuples have only two in-built method : \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to lists because tuples are designed to be lightweight and efficient. Tuples are typically used to represent small, fixed collections of data that do not need to be modified, and the count and index methods are sufficient for most use cases. On the other hand, lists are more flexible and powerful, as they allow you to add, remove, and modify elements, so they have more built-in methods to support these operations.\n"
